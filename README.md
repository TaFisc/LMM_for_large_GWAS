## LMM Tools and PLINK2 Installation

The following tools (and any necessary dependencies) were installed according to each tool's Wiki page (in this repo).
* BOLT-LMM
* SAIGE
* SUGEN (so far not entirely functional?)
* REGENIE
* PLINK2

## Preprocessing & File Preparation

Original simulated data files generated by Dr. Wheeler; n=5000 plink files with a continuous and a categorical/case-control phenotype file. True beta values for both phenotypes also provided. Located in:
```
#plink files
/home/data/simualted_gwas/simu_genos*
#pheno files
/home/data/simulated_gwas/simu*.phen
#true beta values
/home/data/simulated_gwas/simu*.par
```

Subsetted using subsampling.R and subsampling2.sh. path to subsetted plink files: 
```
/home/igregga/LMM_files/*simu-genos* 
#test if you can read them
head /home/igregga/LMM_files/*simu-genos.bim
```
VCF file conversion using plink_to_vcf.sh. path:
```
/home/igregga/LMM_files/vcfs/
```
Header added to pheno files using cat on the command line. Case/control coding converted from 1/2/-9 to 0/1/NA using convert_casecontrol_codes.R. path:
```
/home/igregga/LMM_files/phenos/
```
## Benchmark Runs

*Note: all commands can be run from inside the `LMM_for_large_GWAS` repo directory.??*

For benchmark runs, each tool was set to use 2 threads where possible. Time was measured using the `time` command and memory usage by `/usr/bin/time --verbose`, which logs the maximum resident set size. The general command format:
```
time /usr/bin/time --verbose <tool command>
```
This was incorporated into each of the tool-specific shell scripts detailed below.

### BOLT-LMM

The script to run BOLT, `run_BOLT.sh`, first completes a GWAS for the continous trait (looping through each of the subsets) and then completes a GWAS for the categorical trait. 

Command to run:
```
nohup bash run_BOLT.sh > nohup_BOLT.out &
```
Location of results files:
```
# final BOLT output for continous trait:
/home/tfischer1/LMM_for_large_GWAS/BOLT_results/1250simu-genos_qt_stats.tab 
/home/tfischer1/LMM_for_large_GWAS/BOLT_results/2500simu-genos_qt_stats.tab
/home/tfischer1/LMM_for_large_GWAS/BOLT_results/5000simu-genos_qt_stats.tab

# final output for categorical:
/home/tfischer1/LMM_for_large_GWAS/BOLT_results/1250simu-genos_cc_stats.tab
/home/tfischer1/LMM_for_large_GWAS/BOLT_results/2500simu-genos_cc_stats.tab

# log file:
/home/tfischer1/LMM_for_large_GWAS/nohup_BOLT.out 
```

### SAIGE

SAIGE requires two steps for each GWAS run. The first step fits a null model. We used a full GRM (Genetic Relationship Matrix). The second step performs a single-variant association test.

The benchmark script for SAIGE, `run_SAIGE.sh`, first completes the two-step GWAS for the continous trait (looping through the subset sizes) and then does the same for the categorical trait. Note that time and memory are measured separately for step 1 and step 2 of each run.

Command to run:
```
nohup bash run_SAIGE.sh > nohup_SAIGE.out &
```
Location of results files:
```
# final SAIGE output for continous trait:
/home/tfischer1/LMM_for_large_GWAS/SAIGE_results/1250_qt_fullGRM_with_vr.txt
/home/tfischer1/LMM_for_large_GWAS/SAIGE_results/2500_qt_fullGRM_with_vr.txt
/home/tfischer1/LMM_for_large_GWAS/SAIGE_results/5000_qt_fullGRM_with_vr.txt

# for categorical trait:
/home/tfischer1/LMM_for_large_GWAS/SAIGE_results/1250_cc_fullGRM_with_vr.txt
/home/tfischer1/LMM_for_large_GWAS/SAIGE_results/2500_cc_fullGRM_with_vr.txt
/home/tfischer1/LMM_for_large_GWAS/SAIGE_results/5000_cc_fullGRM_with_vr.txt

# log file:
/home/tfischer1/LMM_for_large_GWAS/nohup_SAIGE.out  
```

### SUGEN

SUGEN has a weird error. See wiki page.

### REGENIE

REGENIE like SAIGE also takes two steps, both wrapped in run_REGENIE.sh and run_REGENIE-binary.sh (one for continuous pheno, one categorical/binary pheno). Run with:
```
nohup /home/igregga/LMM_for_large_GWAS/run_REGENIE.sh > /home/igregga/regenie-out/regeniecont.log &
nohup /home/igregga/LMM_for_large_GWAS/run_REGENIE-binary.sh > /home/igregga/regenie-out/regeniecat.log &
```
Tool generates multiple log files for each run, and prints much of this info to command line (so it's a very long nohup log). The actual results are:
```
/home/igregga/regenie-out/*.regenie
```

### PLINK2
