## LMM Tools and PLINK2 Installation

The following tools (and any necessary dependencies) were installed according to each tool's Wiki page (in this repo).
* BOLT-LMM
* SAIGE
* SUGEN (so far not entirely functional?)
* REGENIE
* PLINK2

## Preprocessing & File Preparation

Original simulated data files generated by Dr. Wheeler; n=5000 plink files with a continuous and a categorical/case-control phenotype file. True beta values for both phenotypes also provided. Located in:
```
#plink files
/home/data/simualted_gwas/simu_genos*
#pheno files
/home/data/simulated_gwas/simu*.phen
#true beta values
/home/data/simulated_gwas/simu*.par
```

Subsetted using subsampling.R and subsampling2.sh. path to subsetted plink files: 
```
/home/igregga/LMM_files/*simu-genos* 
#test if you can read them
head /home/igregga/LMM_files/*simu-genos.bim
```
VCF file conversion using plink_to_vcf.sh. path:
```
/home/igregga/LMM_files/vcfs/
```
Header added to pheno files using cat on the command line. Case/control coding converted from 1/2/-9 to 0/1/NA using convert_casecontrol_codes.R. path:
```
/home/igregga/LMM_files/phenos/
```
## Benchmark Runs

*Note: all commands can be run from inside the `LMM_for_large_GWAS` repo directory.??*

For benchmark runs, each tool was set to use 2 threads where possible. Time was measured using the `time` command and memory usage by `/usr/bin/time --verbose`, which logs the maximum resident set size. The general command format:
```
time /usr/bin/time --verbose <tool command>
```
This was incorporated into each of the tool-specific shell scripts detailed below.

### BOLT-LMM

The script to run BOLT, `run_BOLT.sh`, first completes a GWAS for the continous trait (looping through each of the subsets) and then completes a GWAS for the categorical trait. 

Command to run:
```
nohup bash run_BOLT.sh > nohup_BOLT.out &
```
Location of results files:
```
# final BOLT output for continous trait:
/home/tfischer1/LMM_for_large_GWAS/BOLT_results/1250simu-genos_qt_stats.tab 
/home/tfischer1/LMM_for_large_GWAS/BOLT_results/2500simu-genos_qt_stats.tab
/home/tfischer1/LMM_for_large_GWAS/BOLT_results/5000simu-genos_qt_stats.tab

# final output for categorical:
/home/tfischer1/LMM_for_large_GWAS/BOLT_results/1250simu-genos_cc_stats.tab
/home/tfischer1/LMM_for_large_GWAS/BOLT_results/2500simu-genos_cc_stats.tab
/home/tfischer1/LMM_for_large_GWAS/BOLT_results/5000simu-genos_cc_stats.tab

# log file:
/home/tfischer1/LMM_for_large_GWAS/nohup_BOLT.out 
```

### SAIGE

SAIGE requires two steps for each GWAS run. The first step fits a null model. We used a full GRM (Genetic Relationship Matrix). The second step performs a single-variant association test.

The benchmark script for SAIGE, `run_SAIGE.sh`, first completes the two-step GWAS for the continous trait (looping through the subset sizes) and then does the same for the categorical trait. Note that time and memory are measured separately for step 1 and step 2 of each run.

Command to run:
```
nohup bash run_SAIGE.sh > nohup_SAIGE.out &
```
Location of results files:
```
# final SAIGE output for continous trait:
/home/tfischer1/LMM_for_large_GWAS/SAIGE_results/1250_qt_fullGRM_with_vr.txt
/home/tfischer1/LMM_for_large_GWAS/SAIGE_results/2500_qt_fullGRM_with_vr.txt
/home/tfischer1/LMM_for_large_GWAS/SAIGE_results/5000_qt_fullGRM_with_vr.txt

# for categorical trait:
/home/tfischer1/LMM_for_large_GWAS/SAIGE_results/1250_cc_fullGRM_with_vr.txt
/home/tfischer1/LMM_for_large_GWAS/SAIGE_results/2500_cc_fullGRM_with_vr.txt
/home/tfischer1/LMM_for_large_GWAS/SAIGE_results/5000_cc_fullGRM_with_vr.txt

# log file:
/home/tfischer1/LMM_for_large_GWAS/nohup_SAIGE.out  
```

### SUGEN

SUGEN has a weird error. See wiki page.

### REGENIE

REGENIE like SAIGE also takes two steps, both wrapped in run_REGENIE.sh and run_REGENIE-binary.sh (one for continuous pheno, one categorical/binary pheno). Run with:
```
nohup /home/igregga/LMM_for_large_GWAS/run_REGENIE.sh > /home/igregga/regenie-out/regeniecont.log &
nohup /home/igregga/LMM_for_large_GWAS/run_REGENIE-binary.sh > /home/igregga/regenie-out/regeniecat.log &
```
Tool generates multiple log files for each run, and prints much of this info to command line (so it's a very long nohup log). The actual results are:
```
/home/igregga/regenie-out/*.regenie
```

### PLINK2
The script to run PLINK2, `run_PLINK2.sh`, completes a GWAS for the continuous trait for each subset and then the categorical. 

The command to run the plink2 script is:
```
nohup bash run_PLINK2.sh > PLINK2.out &
```
Location of results files, including the log file, can all be found in the same directory: `/home/wprice2/gwas_results`.

## Analysis

True beta values were provided (see above) for 10,000 of the 1.6mil total SNPs. We filtered these down to remove any beta values less than abs val of 1, which leaves 3105 'causal' SNPs for the categorical trait and 3115 'causal' SNPs for the continuous trait. These filtered files are located:
```
/home/igregga/LMM_files/phenos/simu-*_filtered.par
```
